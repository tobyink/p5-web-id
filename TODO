- Refactor:
	* Drop RSA role, merging into RSAKey
	* Make the _rsa attribute in Certificate public
	* Certificate::rsa => (
		isa => 'RSAKey',
		handles => [qw[public_exponent modulus]]
	);

- Documentation for:

	Web::Id::SAN::Email (class)
	Web::Id::SAN::URI (class)
	Web::Id::Types (type lib)
	Web::Id::RSAKey (class)
	Web::Id::RSA (role)

- Some sort of optional caching mechanism - probably at the Plack end.
