- Some sort of optional caching mechanism - probably at the Plack end.

- Create a test that:
	* launches test HTTPS server
	* gets its port number
	* creates webid cert with URI on that server
	* configures test HTTP server to respond to request for graph
	* does a Web::Id->new(pem => $pem)
	* (can't do the full HTTPS stuff because test http server only does http)
