=head1 NAME

Web::ID::SAN - represents a single name from a certificate's subjectAltName field

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Constructor

=over

=item C<< new >>

Standard Moose-style constructor. (This class uses L<Any::Moose>.)

=back

=head2 Attributes

=over

=item C<< type >>

Something like 'uniformResourceIdentifier' or 'rfc822Name'. A string.

=item C<< value >>

The name itself. A string.

=item C<< model >>

An RDF::Trine::Model representing data about the subject identified by
this name.

To be useful, the C<model> needs to be buildable automatically given
C<type> and C<value>.

=item C<< key_factory >>

This is similar to the C<san_factory> found in L<Web::ID::Certificate>.
It's a coderef used to construct L<Web::ID::RSAKey> objects.

=back

=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<< uri_object >>

Forces the name to take the form of a URI identifying the subject. It's
not always an especially interesting URI.

=item C<< to_string >>

A printable form of the name. Not always very pretty.

=item C<< associated_keys >>

Finds RSA keys associated with this name in C<model>, and returns them as
a list of L<Web::ID::RSAKey> objects.

=back
