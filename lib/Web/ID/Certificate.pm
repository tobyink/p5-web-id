=head1 NAME

Web::ID::Certificate - an x509 certificate

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $cert = Web::ID::Certificate->new(pem => $pem_encoded_x509);
 foreach (@{ $cert->subject_alt_names })
 {
   say "SAN: ", $_->type, " = ", $_->value;
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Constructor

=over

=item C<< new >>

Standard Moose-style constructor. 

=back

=head2 Attributes

=over

=item C<< pem >>

A PEM-encoded string for the certificate.

This is usually the only attribute you want to pass to the constructor.
Allow the others to be built automatically.

=item C<< public_key >>

A L<Web::ID::RSAKey> object.

=item C<< fingerprint >>

A string identifier for the certificate. It is the lower-cased
hexadecimal SHA1 hash of the DER-encoded certificate.

This is not used in WebID authentication, but may be used as an
identifier for the certificate if you need to keep it in a cache.

=item C<< not_before >>

L<DateTime> object indicating when the certificate started (or will
start) to be valid.

=item C<< not_after >>

L<DateTime> object indicating when the certificate will cease (or
has ceased) to be valid.

=item C<< subject_alt_names >>

An arrayref containing a list of subject alt names (L<Web::ID::SAN>
objects) associated with the certificate. These are sorted in the order
they'll be tried for WebID authentication. 

=item C<< san_factory >>

A coderef used for building L<Web::ID::SAN> objects. It's very unlikely
you need to play with this - the default is probably OK. But changing this
is "supported" (in so much as any of this is supported).

The coderef is passed a hash (not hashref) along the lines of:

 (
   type  => 'uniformResourceIdentifier',
   value => 'http://example.com/id/alice',
 )

=back

=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<< timely >>

Checks C<not_before> and C<not_after> against the current system time to
indicate whether the certifixate is temporally valid. Returns a boolean.

You can optionally pass it a L<DateTime> object to use instead of the
current system time.

=item C<< exponent >>

Delegated to the C<public_key> attribute.

=item C<< modulus >>

Delegated to the C<public_key> attribute.

=back

ability to generate new WebID certificates.

L<Crypt::X509> provides a pure Perl X.509 certificate parser, and is
used internally by this module.
