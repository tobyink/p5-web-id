=head1 NAME

Web::ID - implementation of WebID (a.k.a. FOAF+SSL)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $webid = Web::ID->new(certificate => $pem_encoded_x509);
 if ($webid->valid)
 {
   say "Authenticated as: ", $webid->uri;
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WebID is a simple authentication protocol based on TLS (Transaction
Layer Security, better known as Secure Socket Layer, SSL) and the
Semantic Web. This module provides a Perl implementation for
authenticating clients using WebID.

For more information see the L<Web::ID::FAQ> document.

Bundled with this module are L<Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID>, a
plugin for L<Plack> to perform WebID authentication on HTTPS
connections; and L<Web::ID::Certificate::Generator>, a module that
allows you to generate WebID-enabled certificates that can be
installed into web browsers.

=head2 Constructor

=over

=item C<< new >>

Standard Moose-style constructor. (This class uses L<Any::Moose>.)

=back

=head2 Attributes

=over

=item C<< certificate >>

A L<Web::ID::Certificate> object representing and x509 certificate,
though a PEM-encoded string will be coerced.

This is usually the only attribute you want to pass to the constructor.
Allow the others to be built automatically.

=item C<< first_valid_san >>

Probably fairly uninteresting. This is the first subjectAltName value
found in the certificate that could be successfully authenticated
using Web::ID. An L<Web::ID::SAN> object.

=item C<< uri >>

The URI associated with the first valid SAN. A L<URI> object.

This is a URI you can use to identify the person, organisation or
robotic poodle holding the certificate.

=item C<< profile >>

Data about the certificate holder. An L<RDF::Trine::Model> object.
Their FOAF file (probably).

=item C<< valid >>

Boolean.

=back

=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<< node >>

Returns the same as C<uri>, but as an L<RDF::Trine::Node> object.

=item C<< get(@predicates) >>

Queries the C<profile> for triples of the form:

  $self->node $predicate $x .

And returns literal and URI values for $x, as strings.

C<< $predicate >> should be an L<RDF::Trine::Node>, or a string. If a
string, it will be expanded using L<RDF::Trine::NamespaceMap>, so you 
can do stuff like:

  my $name   = $webid->get('foaf:name', 'rdfs:label');
  my @mboxes = $webid->get('foaf:mbox');

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Web::ID::FAQ>.

L<Web::ID::Certificate>,
L<Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID>.

L<RDF::ACL> provides an access control system that complements WebID.

L<CGI::Auth::FOAF_SSL> is the spiritual ancestor of this module though
they share very little code, and have quite different APIs.

=head1 THANKS

Thanks to Kjetil Kjernsmo (cpan:KJETILK) for persuading me to port my old
CGI-specific implementaton of this to Plack.

Thanks to Henry Story, Melvin Carvalho, Bruno Harbulot, Ian Jacobi and
many others for developing WebID from a poorly thought out idea to a 
clever, yet simple and practical authentication protocol.

Thanks to Gregory Williams (cpan:GWILLIAMS), Tatsuhiko Miyagawa
(cpan:MIYAGAWA) and the Moose Cabal for providing really good platforms
(RDF::Trine, Plack and Moose respectively) to build this on.
