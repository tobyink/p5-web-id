=head1 NAME

Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID - authentication middleware for WebID

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Plack::Builder;
  
  my $app   = sub { ... };
  my $cache = CHI->new( ... );
  
  sub unauthenticated
  {
    my ($self, $env) = @_;
    return [
      403,
      [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ],
      [ '403 Forbidden' ],
    ];
  }
  
  builder
  {
    enable "Auth::WebID",
        cache     => $cache,
        on_unauth => \&unauthenticated;
    $app;
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID is a WebID handler for Plack.

If authentication is successful, then the handler sets C<< $env->{WEBID} >>
to the user's WebID URI, and sets C<< $env->{WEBID_OBJECT} >> to a
L<Web::ID> object.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item cache

This may be set to an object that will act as a cache for Web::ID
objects. 

Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID does not care what package you use for
your caching needs. L<CHI>, L<Cache::Cache> and L<Cache> should all
work. In fact, any package that provides a similar one-argument C<get>
and a two-argument C<set> ought to work. Which should you use? Well
CHI seems to be best, however it's Moose-based, so usually too slow
for CGI applications. Use Cache::Cache for CGI, and CHI otherwise.

You don't need to set a cache at all, but if there's no cache, then
reauthentication (which is computationally expensive) happens for
every request. Use of a cache with an expiration time of around 15
minutes should significantly speed up the responsiveness of a
WebID-secured site. (For forking servers you probably want a cache
that is shared between processes, such as a memcached cache.)

=item on_unauth

Coderef that will be called if authentication is not successful. You
can use this to return a "403 Forbidden" page for example, or try an
alternative authentication method.

The default coderef used will simply run the application as normal,
but setting C<< $env->{WEBID} >> to the empty string.

=item webid_class

Name of an alternative class to use for WebID authentication instead
of L<Web::ID>. Note that any such class would need to provide a compatible
C<new> constructor.

=item certificate_env_key

The key within C<< $env >> where Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID can find
a PEM-encoded client SSL certificate.

Apache keeps this information in C<< $env->{'SSL_CLIENT_CERT'} >>, so
it should be no surprise that this setting defaults to 'SSL_CLIENT_CERT'.

=item no_object_please

Suppresses setting C<< $env->{WEBID_OBJECT} >>. C<< $env->{WEBID} >> will
still be set as usual.

=head1 SERVER SUPPORT

WebID is an authentication system based on the Semantic Web and HTTPS.
It relies on client certificates (but not on certification authorities;
self-signed certificates are OK).

So for this authentication module to work...

=over

=item * You need to be using a server which supports HTTPS.

Many web PSGI web servers (e.g. HTTP::Server::Simple, Starman, etc) do
not support HTTPS natively. In some cases these are used with an HTTPS
proxy in front of them.

=item * Your HTTPS server needs to request a client certificate from the client.

=item * Your HTTPS server needs to expose the client certificate to Plack via C<< $env >>.

If you're using an HTTPS proxy in front of a non-HTTPS web server,
then you might need to be creative to find a way to forward this
information to your backend web server.

=item * The client browser needs to have a WebID-compatible certificate installed.

Nuff said.

=back

=head2 Apache2 (mod_perl and CGI)

The B<SSLVerifyClient> directive can be used to tell Apache that you want it
to request a certificate from the client.

Apache is able to deposit the certifcate in an environment variable called
SSL_CLIENT_CERT. However by default it might not. Check out the B<SSLOptions>
directive and enable the C<ExportCertData> option, or if you're using mod_perl
try L<Plack::Middleware::Apache2::ModSSL>.

=head2 Gepok

L<Gepok> is one of a very small number of PSGI-compatible web servers that
supports HTTPS natively. As of 0.19 it does not request client certificates,
however there is a fork which provides client certificate support at
L<https://github.com/tobyink/p5-gepok>, which will hopefully be merged into
the release versions of Gepok at some point in the near future.

This still doesn't give you the certificate in C<< $env >> though. I'm
working on some Plack middleware to do that. It will be released as
L<Plack::Middleware::GepokX::ModSSL> in due course.
